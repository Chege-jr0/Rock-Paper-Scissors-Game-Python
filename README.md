In my code I used the functions and then called them in the main function.
I first of all imported the random function.
The first function was the get_user_choice function which gets the choice from the user and converts the input to lowercase and also check if the choice is valid
The second function is the get_computer_choice function which uses the random function to get the computers choice.
The third function is for determining the winner and returns a tuple to award points accordingly.
The main function is where everything is executed 
It first of all checks whether the number of rounds the user wants to play an iterates accordingly.
The functions for the get_user_choice function and get_computer_choice function are aassigned to user_choice and computer_choice accordingly
The user_points and computer_points are added to the running total.
If the user_score >= max points or computer_score>= max points which is set.
The final score is calculated and then it is printed
The code is executed and it is running smoothly.
